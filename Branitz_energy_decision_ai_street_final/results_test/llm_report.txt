To decide between heating options for Branitz, we have evaluated four scenarios, including two district heating (DH) and two heat pump (HP) scenarios. Below are the key findings and trade-offs for each:

### District Heating Scenarios:

1. **Base DH**: This scenario modeled a 4th generation DH system using biomass with standard weather conditions. Unfortunately, the simulation did not yield results because the hydraulic calculations failed to converge. This indicates potential technical design constraints in the network's capability to handle the DH system, possibly due to complexities or inadequacies in the infrastructure configuration or assumptions regarding flow rates.

2. **Low-Temp DH**: Similarly, this scenario attempted with reduced supply (60°C) and return (35°C) temperatures alongside improved building insulation. However, it also did not produce results due to hydraulic calculation failures, signaling similar design or network issues as seen in the Base DH scenario.

### Heat Pump Scenarios:

3. **Full HP**: This scenario considers a full rollout of heat pumps in all residential buildings with no grid reinforcement for peak demand times. It achieved an average Levelized Cost of Heating (LCoH) of €110.37 per MWh and results in CO₂ emissions of 99.43 tons per annum. However, there was one instance of transformer overload, and the maximum feeder load reached 82% of capacity. This suggests the need for careful monitoring and potential future upgrades to avoid regular overloads or to accommodate growth in electricity demand.

4. **HP with Grid Reinforcement**: This scenario includes additional investments to support grid reinforcement, which is crucial to manage peak hour demands. Despite this, the core KPIs remained the same as the Full HP scenario, indicating that current load management and grid capacity were adequate enough with minimal incremental benefits from reinforcement under the present conditions.

### Key Considerations:

- **Cost**: Both HP scenarios show an identical cost, with the grid-reinforcement scenario not providing a cost reduction but potentially offering more grid stability over time.
- **Emissions**: Both HP scenarios have relatively low emissions, consistent with using electricity as a heat source.
- **Grid Reliability**: Despite reinforcement, a single transformer overload was noted, implying transformer or feeder upgrades might be necessary under high-demand scenarios.

### Recommendation:

In the current analysis, **heat pump scenarios** emerge as the more viable options due to unresolved technical challenges with district heating. While both HP options share similar performance in cost and emissions, adopting a grid-reinforcement strategy might be necessary to safeguard against future reliability issues as demand grows. 

Therefore, it is recommended to pursue the "HP with Grid Reinforcement" scenario. This strategy aligns with sustainable energy goals and can offer improved system resilience, ensuring Branitz can efficiently manage its heating needs while minimizing emissions. Regular evaluations for grid conditions are advised to preemptively address any potential overload situations.
