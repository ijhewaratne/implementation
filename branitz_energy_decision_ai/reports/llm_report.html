<p>To aid Branitz's urban decarbonization efforts, we evaluated four heating scenarios focusing on district heating (DH) and decentralized heat pumps (HP). These were assessed using key performance indicators like Levelized Cost of Heat (LCoH), CO₂ emissions, pressure drops, and grid impacts.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Base DH and Low-Temperature DH</strong>:</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Both scenarios employ 4th generation district heating using biomass, differing in supply temperatures.</li>
<li><strong>LCoH</strong>: At €176.88 per MWh, these remain the same for both scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>CO₂ Emissions</strong>: Both record emissions of 87.25 tons annually, which are notably lower than the heat pump scenarios.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Technical Constraints</strong>: They show a maximum pressure drop of 0.7 bars and a pump energy requirement of 3,000 kWh. They do not provide specific figures for feeder load or transformer overloads, implying stability in these respects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Full HP and HP with Grid Reinforcement</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: Both scenarios deploy heat pumps across all residential buildings, with grid reinforcement added in one scenario.</li>
<li><strong>LCoH</strong>: Both have a lower cost of €110.37 per MWh due primarily to more efficient heat pump operation (COP of 3.5).</li>
<li><strong>CO₂ Emissions</strong>: At 99.43 tons annually, these are higher than district heating due to the current electricity grid mix, which is less renewable than the biomass source for DH.</li>
<li><strong>Technical Strain</strong>: Notable potential for grid issues with 82% feeder load and at least one instance of transformer overload, reflecting stress on existing infrastructure, especially at peak times.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Key Trade-offs:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost vs. Emissions</strong>: Heat pumps offer lower operational costs but at the expense of higher emissions under the current grid conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure Impact</strong>: Heat pump scenarios impose significant strain on electrical infrastructure, requiring careful consideration of reinforcement needs.</li>
<li><strong>Stability</strong>: District heating scenarios present stable operation, less reliance on grid conditions, and better emission profiles, making them attractive for a more stable and sustainable long-term strategy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recommendation:</h3>
<p>Considering both cost efficiency and emissions as priorities, if grid reinforcement for heat pump scenarios is feasible and aligns with future grid decarbonization efforts, pursuing "hp_with_grid_reinforcement" offers an economical choice but necessitates infrastructure investment. However, if stability and immediate emissions reduction take precedence, "low_temp_dh" presents a more robust and environmentally favorable option. This approach requires no additional investment in grid infrastructure and leverages existing biomass technology. Environmental regulations and future grid decarbonization trajectories should guide the final decision to ensure a sustainable outcome.</p>
<p>Stakeholders are encouraged to weigh these factors against budget constraints, infrastructure capabilities, and long-term sustainability goals.</p>
